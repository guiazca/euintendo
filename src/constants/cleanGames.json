    "description": "<p>Alien: Isolation is an action-survival horror game played from the first-person perspective for a more intense experience. The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.</p>",

    "description_raw": "Alien: Isolation is an action-survival horror game played from the first-person perspective for a more intense experience. The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies."

Purchase and download this content before March 14th for early access to one of the courses! The remainder of the DLC will be available on March 14th. Naturally, you can play all of the courses with a friend or alone. Either way, you’ll dodge dangers and track treasures across many trap-filled miniature worlds; some are even based on the Super Mario Odyssey™ game!<br />\nCaptain Toad stars in his own puzzling quest on the Nintendo Switch™ system! Our stubby hero must dodge dangers and track treasures across many trap-filled courses. Survive smoldering volcanoes, hazardous steam engines, haunted houses, and even new courses based on the Super Mario Odyssey™ game! Luckily, a second player can join in by tossing turnips at enemies.<br />\nPlay anytime, anywhere, and anyway you want—even in two-player mode using a pair of Joy-Con™ controllers on one Nintendo Switch system—in TV mode or Tabletop mode.

Carrying out their orders are THE HORSEMEN, Nephilim (powerful beings spawned from the unnatural union of angels and demons) who have pledged themselves to the Council and been granted immense power.  However, this power came at a tragic cost: the Horsemen were ordered to use their newfound strength to wipe out the rest of their kind.  What followed was a bloody battle on Eden where the Horsemen, obeying the will of the Council, annihilated the Nephilim.\nStill reeling from the events on Eden, WAR and STRIFE have been given a new assignment -- LUCIFER, the enigmatic and deceptive demon king, has been plotting to upset the Balance by granting power to master demons throughout Hell.  War and Strife must hunt down these masters, gather information, and ultimately fight their way through a tangled, demonic conspiracy that threatens to forever upset the Balance and unravel all of creation.\nDARKSIDERS: GENESIS is an action/adventure that tears its way through hordes of demons, angels, and everything in-between on its way to Hell and back with guns blazing and swords swinging.  Genesis gives players their first look at the world of DARKSIDERS before the events of the original game, as well as introduces the horseman STRIFE.Features:Blast angels and demons as the gunslinging Horseman Strife, playable for the first time\nSwap between the powerful swordsman War and Strife instantly in frenetic, single-player gameplay\nExplore the epic world of Darksiders and wreak havoc with a friend in two-player cooperative mode\nExperience a brand new story campaign that takes place before the original Darksiders, exploring the origin of the Seven Seals\nGrow in strength and power as you collect items, abilities, weapon enhancements, creature cores and more"

    "description": "<p>Dead Cells is a roguelike adventure title developed by Motion Twin.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>Not much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner&#39;s body, and gets back to the game&#39;s starting area. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.</p>\n<p>Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.</p>\n<p>The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. </p>\n<p>The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can&#39;t take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.</p>",

    "description_raw": "Dead Cells is a roguelike adventure title developed by Motion Twin.\n\n###Story\nNot much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body, and gets back to the game's starting area. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game's heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.\n\nDead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.\n\nThe players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. \n\nThe game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves."

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots&#39; behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br />\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you&#39;re allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn&#39;t right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren&#39;t in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br />\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy&#39;s?<br />\n&quot;For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.&quot; -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com<br />\nThis game was created using Clickteam Fusion!</p>",

No backtracking. No metroidvania gimmicks or item collection. Every level is a unique and lovingly designed challenge to overcome.\nA rich story filled with unique characters, all tied into the gameplay and level design."

Party at your own pace by suspending a game and picking up right where you left off! The tides can turn quickly in Mario Party, so stay vigilant, partygoers. All modes can be played online*, too!\n\nPlay 100 classic minigames from the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube™ games and more in Mt. Minigames!\n\nTry your hand at a superstar collection of minigames from throughout the Mario Party series. Whether you are saving up coins for stars in board game mode or enjoy one of the 7 modes included in Mt. Minigames, there is nothing quite like being the last one standing in Bumper Balls or the first team making it out of the darkness in Dungeon Duos. All minigames are played with button controls, so you can stick to the Joy-Con™ controller or bust out the Nintendo Switch™ Pro Controller or a Nintendo Switch Lite system.\n\nParty with superstars near or far\n\nBring the party anytime, anywhere with same-system**, local wireless**, or online* play. Use stickers to praise or pester fellow players as you race across the board collecting stars.

    "description": "<p>Raji: An Ancient Epic is an action adventure game set in ancient India. Raji, a young girl is chosen by the gods, to stand against the demonic invasion of the human realm. Her destiny to rescue her younger brother and face the demon lord Mahabalasura.<br />\n---Key Features---<br />\nBreathtaking Hand Painted Environment<br />\nHand Painted art style</p>\n<p>Each and every corner of Raji: An Ancient Epic is hand painted, this utilises the use of several softwares, dedication and countless hours. The environment is inspired by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, which was the pinnacle of architectural achievement during the medieval era of India.<br />\nThis inspired us and thus the art style naturally went down a route of hand painting each and every texture, which can be reflected in every pixel of the game. All thanks to our environment artist, since she comes with a Fine Art background and special expertise that suits the game.<br />\n​</p>\n<p>Unique Character Artstyle<br />\nReflecting Southeast Asia in an Indian game</p>\n<p>Our character art style reflects inspiration from Southeast Asia, the art team went to Bali, Indonesia to study more about the mythology and the background of the island. The art team were heavily influenced by the demonic statues and sculptures that were later infused within the characters of the game.<br />\n​<br />\nA Story Of Siblings<br />\nA sister on a rescue mission, against all odds</p>\n<p>Raji: An Ancient Epic takes you through an intense and emotional story of Raji, who is determined to find her brother and bring peace to the human realm. The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic is a witness of how Raji evolves through the atrocities of war and the loss of loved ones. She takes upon herself to find an end to this reckless war, which can only happen if she manages to break down the might and the stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.</p>\n<p>Gritty and Fluid Combat<br />\nChoose your weapons and gods</p>\n<p>The combat of the game offers a mix of fluidity in movement and attacks going against powerful and mystical enemies. The combat is empowering, making one feel like a demigod, but beware, her vulnerability as a human is never far away. The game offers you choices from various weapons as well as god powers gifted to Raji allowing for diversity and letting the player explore their own style of gameplay. Raji will also come across several demon types and subtypes, including mini bosses and epic boss battles.</p>\n<p>Through the Ranks Of The Enemy<br />\nThe bad and the ugly<br />\nAll the demons in the game have their ranks among the army. While Raji can come across a demon from a specific race who gripped a stone mace, she might meet the same demon type later with full fledged armor and advanced weaponry. Not only that, one will come across well equipped demons, several subtypes with varying abilities and mini bosses that can be found lurking in the game.</p>\n<p>Explore Ancient Forts and Solve Environment Puzzles<br />\nForts and Fortresses, secret locations, puzzles and environment storytelling</p>\n<p>The story of the game takes you through various levels which were inspired by gigantic forts of the medieval era, built by Rajput kings of Rajasthan. Not only that these forts allow for tightly packed arenas for combat they also take the player through the massive scale and breathtaking views the forts provide. The levels will also feature secret locations where one might wonder, what would they stumble upon..friend or foe, treasure or trap?</p>\n<p>Each of the handcrafted levels will ask the player to surpass challenges one after another. Various “Mandala” puzzles play an important role in environment storytelling, these were designed to give the player a breather in-between the challenging combat. Certain level locations will be telling their own story, which is upto the players to decipher, our artists and level designer has made these locations keeping in mind the context of the level and the lore of the universe.</p>\n<p>Myths and Culture<br />\nA grand game which inspires from Hindu and Bali mythology</p>\n<p>The setting of the game allows us to seep in small fragments of Hindu and Bali mythology here and there. Various level locations, demons, bosses and characters will be representing distinctive features which draw inspiration from both Hindu and Bali mythology. The team at Nodding Heads Games wants the world to be a witness of the grandeur and bizarreness of a game coming from India, which has never been seen in the gaming industry to date.</p>",

    "description_raw": "Raji: An Ancient Epic is an action adventure game set in ancient India. Raji, a young girl is chosen by the gods, to stand against the demonic invasion of the human realm. Her destiny to rescue her younger brother and face the demon lord Mahabalasura.\n---Key Features---\nBreathtaking Hand Painted Environment\nHand Painted art style\n\nEach and every corner of Raji: An Ancient Epic is hand painted, this utilises the use of several softwares, dedication and countless hours. The environment is inspired by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, which was the pinnacle of architectural achievement during the medieval era of India.\nThis inspired us and thus the art style naturally went down a route of hand painting each and every texture, which can be reflected in every pixel of the game. All thanks to our environment artist, since she comes with a Fine Art background and special expertise that suits the game.\n​\n\nUnique Character Artstyle\nReflecting Southeast Asia in an Indian game\n\nOur character art style reflects inspiration from Southeast Asia, the art team went to Bali, Indonesia to study more about the mythology and the background of the island. The art team were heavily influenced by the demonic statues and sculptures that were later infused within the characters of the game.\n​\nA Story Of Siblings\nA sister on a rescue mission, against all odds\n\nRaji: An Ancient Epic takes you through an intense and emotional story of Raji, who is determined to find her brother and bring peace to the human realm. The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic is a witness of how Raji evolves through the atrocities of war and the loss of loved ones. She takes upon herself to find an end to this reckless war, which can only happen if she manages to break down the might and the stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.\n\nGritty and Fluid Combat\nChoose your weapons and gods\n\nThe combat of the game offers a mix of fluidity in movement and attacks going against powerful and mystical enemies. The combat is empowering, making one feel like a demigod, but beware, her vulnerability as a human is never far away. The game offers you choices from various weapons as well as god powers gifted to Raji allowing for diversity and letting the player explore their own style of gameplay. Raji will also come across several demon types and subtypes, including mini bosses and epic boss battles.\n\n\nThrough the Ranks Of The Enemy\nThe bad and the ugly\nAll the demons in the game have their ranks among the army. While Raji can come across a demon from a specific race who gripped a stone mace, she might meet the same demon type later with full fledged armor and advanced weaponry. Not only that, one will come across well equipped demons, several subtypes with varying abilities and mini bosses that can be found lurking in the game.\n\n\nExplore Ancient Forts and Solve Environment Puzzles\nForts and Fortresses, secret locations, puzzles and environment storytelling\n\nThe story of the game takes you through various levels which were inspired by gigantic forts of the medieval era, built by Rajput kings of Rajasthan. Not only that these forts allow for tightly packed arenas for combat they also take the player through the massive scale and breathtaking views the forts provide. The levels will also feature secret locations where one might wonder, what would they stumble upon..friend or foe, treasure or trap?\n\nEach of the handcrafted levels will ask the player to surpass challenges one after another. Various “Mandala” puzzles play an important role in environment storytelling, these were designed to give the player a breather in-between the challenging combat. Certain level locations will be telling their own story, which is upto the players to decipher, our artists and level designer has made these locations keeping in mind the context of the level and the lore of the universe.\n\nMyths and Culture\nA grand game which inspires from Hindu and Bali mythology\n\nThe setting of the game allows us to seep in small fragments of Hindu and Bali mythology here and there. Various level locations, demons, bosses and characters will be representing distinctive features which draw inspiration from both Hindu and Bali mythology. The team at Nodding Heads Games wants the world to be a witness of the grandeur and bizarreness of a game coming from India, which has never been seen in the gaming industry to date."

    "description": "<p>Not every survival horror fully explored different styles and formats like Resident Evil did. Resident Evil Revelations keeps the story and mechanics from the previous installments.  It’s set between Resident Evil 4 and 5, taking place right after the creation of BSAA. Agents Jill Valentine and Parker are sent to the cruise ship Queen Zenobia in order to find two missing field agents Chris Redfield and Jessica. But they find a trap, set by a bioterrorist organization Veltro. And now players will have to solve puzzles and to kill monsters. <br />\nRevelations are using an episodic storytelling format, separating single player campaign into different segments, allowing players to experience different scenarios and play as several characters throughout the game. But it keeps the main focus and the events on the ghost ship. But aside from the single-player campaign, players can try to complete modified story mode scenarios, fitted for the combat survival. Completing the Raid Mode objectives will allow one or two players to receive experience points and weapons.</p>",

    "description_raw": "Not every survival horror fully explored different styles and formats like Resident Evil did. Resident Evil Revelations keeps the story and mechanics from the previous installments.  It’s set between Resident Evil 4 and 5, taking place right after the creation of BSAA. Agents Jill Valentine and Parker are sent to the cruise ship Queen Zenobia in order to find two missing field agents Chris Redfield and Jessica. But they find a trap, set by a bioterrorist organization Veltro. And now players will have to solve puzzles and to kill monsters. \nRevelations are using an episodic storytelling format, separating single player campaign into different segments, allowing players to experience different scenarios and play as several characters throughout the game. But it keeps the main focus and the events on the ghost ship. But aside from the single-player campaign, players can try to complete modified story mode scenarios, fitted for the combat survival. Completing the Raid Mode objectives will allow one or two players to receive experience points and weapons."

It does not, however, affect character’s stats or restrict him from acquiring any skills from the Skill Tree later in the game. \nThe combat relies on different types of attacks, dodging, blocking and use of various abilities and items. There are more than 600 weapons, pieces of armor, disposable items and other equipment that can be found throughout the game. \nThe game features local multiplayer, both cooperative and competitive."

The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy.
